This is a game that I am working on. Everything is coded from scratch. 

I am currenlty using the HandMadeHero series to figure out what to do next. 

Would recommend this to anyone that has time. Will make you a more confident programmer.

Currently it has a small "animation" if you can even call it. Epelepsie warning.
